<h4>Instruction</h4>
<div id='blocklyInstruction'></div><script>injectInstruction('communications_wifi_iot_thingsboard_setup','blocklyInstruction');</script>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>ThingsBoard is an Open-Source IoT platform that allows you to collect, manage and visualize data for your IoT project. It can be installed on a wide variety of hardwares, from Raspberry Pi to servers in the cloud. You can try a live demo at <a href="https://demo.thingsboard.io">https://demo.thingsboard.io</a>. You will need to create an account to start using the platform. The main important things to know about how to use this platform can be found on their web page <a href="https://thingsboard.io/docs/iot-video-tutorials/">https://thingsboard.io/docs/iot-video-tutorials/</a>.</p>.

<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>Facilino's license.</p>
<p>The ESP8266 card must be installed on the Arduino IDE Board Manager:</p>
<p><image src="doc/common/esp8266_board_manager.png" title="esp8266_board_manager" alt="esp8266_board_manager"></image></p>
<p>These instructions also require to install the PubSubClient library, which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient">https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient</a>.</p>
<h4>Inputs</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Device Name: Name you provide to your device.</li>
   <li>Token: Access token to your device (you can find this token on the Device Credentials).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Setting up a IoT in Thingsboard</h4>
<p>In most of IoT projects, you will need to create 'Customers', 'Devices', 'Dashboards' and 'Widgets'. All these four items are related in the following way. A 'Customer' is who is allowed to use a specific device, you can create one by introducing your name, the name of your school, etc... A 'Customer' is like a user, in the sense that you can allow some 'Custerms' to use a specific device, while others can only use other type of devices. The device is, usually, the name of your electronic board (NodeMCU, ESP32, Arduino Uno WiFi, etc...) together with electronics connected to it, i.e.: for a weather station you can use ' NodeMCU Temp'. A 'Dashboard' is where data is displayed or managed. You can add different types of widgets to a Dashboard to display or manage data in a particular way, such as a chart or a knob and arrange them as you like. You can create your own 'Widgets' or simply configure and customise the existing ones. We suggest to take a look to the type of widgets to adapt your 'Dashboard' to your project specific needs. 'Dashboards' are associated to a 'Device', which means that you will need to indicate the device name on the 'Dashboard'. You can create several 'Dashboards' for the same device, i.e.: for one for monitoring the temperature over the time, another to register alarms, another to remotely control a switch, etc... We suggest to create a 'Dashboard' containing just the data you want to manage or display.</p>
<p>Facilino can deal with widgets that send/receive data to/from your device using RPC (Remote Process Call), attributes or timeseries. See related instructions for specific details on how to manage or display data with Thingsboard.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
This example uses the ESP8266 (integrated) processor to get values from a knob and a switch from a Thingsboard Dashboard. The relay value read from Thingsboard is sent to the digital pin D2 so it is physically interacting. The knob value read from Thingsboard is simply displayed on the console. Temperature values from a DHT11 sensor are sent back to Thingsboard and displayed accordingly on a chart.
