<h4>Instruction</h4>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p class="instruction">This instruction implements a discrete Butterworth first order band-stop filter by specifying low and high cut-off frequencies. If the time difference between the current sampling time and previous sampling time is lower than Ts, then the filter returns the previous output, while if the time difference is larger, the filter updates the output based on current input (and previous inputs and outputs), and, obviously, the cut-off frequency.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p class="instruction">Facilino's license.</p>
<h4>Fields</h4>
<ul class="instruction">
  <li>Name: Name of the filter (must be different for every filter of the same type).</li>
  <li>Ts: Sampling time (in milliseconds).</li>
  <li>Cut-off freq. low: The low cutoff frequency in % Wn must be 0% < Wn < 100%, with 100% corresponding to half the sampling frequency Fs=1/Ts, being Ts the sampling time expected for each measurement. </li>
  <li>Cut-off freq. high: Idem as before, but for the high cutoff frequency.
</ul>
<h4>Inputs</h4>
<ul class="instruction">
  <li>Input: Input signal.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Output</h4>
<p class="instruction">Filtered signal.</p>
