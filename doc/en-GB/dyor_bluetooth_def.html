<h4>Instruction</h4>
<div id='blocklyInstruction'></div>
<script>injectInstruction('dyor_bluetooth_def','blocklyInstruction');</script>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Defines the bluetooth HC-06 module (and similar ones) through serial software communication with commands AT. It configures its speed and the pins to which it is connected. In Arduino UNO (and similar ones), pins 0 and 1 are used for hardware serial communication, whereas this instruction allows to use the Bluetooth HC-06 module through serial communication and therefore the connection of the transmission and reception pins must be specified, as well as the communication speed (default 9600 baud).</p>
<h4>Inputs</h4>
<ul>
   <li>Speed: Baud rate speed. Default value:9600. Note: Above 38400 does not usually work well.</li>
   <li>TX: Arduino transmission pin (connect to RX of HC-06 module).</li>
   <li>RX: Arduino reception pin (connect to TX of HC-06 module).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example</h4>
In this example ASCII characters are read through bluetooth. If the user sends a '0' (48 in ASCII), the two LEDs connected to pins 5 and 6 are light up. If the user sends a '1' (49 to ASCII), the LED connected to pin 6 will light up (LED connected to pin 5 will be off), whereas if a '2' (50 in ASCII) is sent, the LED connected to pin 5 will light up (LED connected to pin 6 will be off). Any other data received will turn off the LEDs.
